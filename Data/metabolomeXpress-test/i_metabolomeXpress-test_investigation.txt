Study Title	Rice & Wheat - coleoptile - 4, 8 and 24h anoxia_Shingaki-Wells (2011b)
Study Submission Date	
Study Public Release Date	2011-05-31
Study Description	Coleoptiles from rice or wheat seedlings transferred from air to anoxia will exhibit a metabolic change that will intensify as the time of anoxic stress increases.Using a gas delivery system, rice and wheat seeds were germinated and grown under air for 4 days. Some plants were transferred to 4, 8 or 24 h anoxia (N2 gas). Coleoptiles were excised and metabolites analysed.

Study Protocol Description	45-80 mg of frozen tissue was weighed out and placed into a pre-cooled 2 mL round-bottom Eppendorf tube. Stored in a 2 mL Eppendorf round-bottom polypropylene tube at -80 degrees C.           	To each tube containing frozen tissue, 500 uL of cold (-20 degrees C) Metabolite Extraction Medium [87% (v/v) HPLC grade MeOH (Sigma), 9% (v/v) untreated MilliQ H2O, 8.7 ug/mL ribitol] was added. Tubes were vortexed briefly, rapidly heated to 65 degrees C and shaken at 1400 RPM for 30 min. Tubes were then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min to pellet insoluble material and 0.4 mL of supernatant was transferred into a new clear 2 mL round-bottom polypropylene Eppendorf tube and stored as a stock extract at -80 degrees C until further analysis. Extracts were taken out of the -80 degrees C freezer and allowed to warm to room temperature. After brief vortexing, 60 uL of extract was transferred to clean 1.5 mL clear polypropylene microfuge tubes before being evaporated to dryness under vacuum in a Labconco centrifugal evaporator without heating overnight for approx. 16 h. None Wet extracts were stored at -80 degrees C in 2 mL clear round-bottom polypropylene Eppendorf tubes. Dried extracts were not stored and used immediately in chromatography sample preparation protocols.         	Dried extracts were methoximated by adding 20 uL of a 20 mg/mL solution of methoxyamine hydrochloride in anhydrous pyridine (99.8 %, Sigma) and incubated at 30 degrees C for 1.5 h with shaking at 1400 RPM. For trimethylsilylation, 30 uL of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA; Sigma) at room temperature was transferred to each tube and tubes were incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 min with 1400 RPM shaking. 10 uL of an n-alkane retention index calibration mixture [0.029% (v/v) n-dodecane, 0.029% (v/v) n-pentadecane, 0.029% (m/v) n-nonadecane, 0.029% (m/v) n-docosane, 0.029% (m/v) n-octacosane, 0.029% (m/v) n-dotracontane, and 0.029% (m/v) n-hexatriacontane dissolved in anhydrous pyridine] was then added to each tube, reaction mixtures were vortexed and transferred to amber GC-MS vials with low volume inserts and crimp-top seals and allowed to incubate at room temperature for at least 4 h prior to beginning GC-MS analysis.
